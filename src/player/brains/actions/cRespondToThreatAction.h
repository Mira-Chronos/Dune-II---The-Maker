/**
 * A simple approach instead of having a function lurking somewhere. We might even benefit from having 'actions' to
 * re-use in AI's. Especially since the Campaign and Skirmish AI's have a lot of overlap.
 *
 * However, by then we might want to have an abstraction for "actions" as well. However, lets not over-engineer.
 *
 * Keep it simple for now.
 *
 * --------
 *
 * This class will make a player respond to a certain 'threat'. It will do that by retaliating with an amount of
 * units (given by 'maxUnitsToOrder' constructor argument). It will take into consideration if a victim unit was
 * passed in. Meaning, when that is a non-attacking unit (ie a Harvester), it will try to run over infantry units (if
 * they were a threat) - or it will flee.
 *
 * When air units attack, only retaliate with anti-air units.
